# VueJS Practice Projects

## Adopt Pets App

The "adopt-pets" directory contains a simple, create-and-read pets app to keep track of pets' basic information.

Data used to generate tables is stored in `/adopt-pets/src/data/...`.

## Chat App

The "chat-app" directory contains a simple, chat app that contains messages in app's memory, so there is no persistance on the messages. The app was created using Express.js as a server with Socket.io to keep track of the client session.

## Quiz App

The "quiz" directory contains a simple, quiz app that makes a GET request to a quiz service provider ([opentdb.com](https://opentdb.com)) and retrieves a response of 10 questions in the film and arts category.
